# SLAM Algorithm Implementation - Probabilistic Robotics

## 1. Introduction
This project contains Python3 implementations and results of a variety of state estimation and SLAM algorithms in Sebastian Thrun's book Probabilistic Robotics  using UTIAS Multi-Robot Cooperative Localization and Mapping Dataset.

As a beginner in SLAM, I always found it difficult to understand the non-intuitive mathematical equations, and I can barely find straightforward instructions on implementing these algorithms. Therefore, I created this repo to demonstrate the basic concepts behind the book, paired with results running on a simple dataset.

If you are new to SLAM problem and is reading the book Probabilistic Robotics, this repo will be perfect for you - I programmed in Python not C++ with abundant inline comments and good demonstrations of the results.

If you find anything wrong with my implementations, such as wrong understanding or code bugs, please leave a comment!
